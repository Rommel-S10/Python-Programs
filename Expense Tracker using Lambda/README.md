This is a small Command Line Expense Tracker using Lambda expression. Lambda, also known as anonymous functions, are used for short and simple functions. 

With Lambdas we can filer, sum everything in a list, etc. 

In the main function there is a while a loop and runs the programm until the user decides to exit just like a video game. Simple and not confusing.
