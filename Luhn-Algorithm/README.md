# Descritpition 

Luhn-Algorith  is a simple checksum formula used to validate various most notably credit card numbers. It's a basic but effective method for detecting typing errors and other inconsistencies in these numbers. 

Even though there are newer algorith that checks for card numbers, Luhn is still even used due to it is simplity and effectiveness. 

# Example of in invalid card:

    Let's do card with the numbers 49927398716 to see it is valid.

        1. Double every other digit: 49927398716 becomes 49927398716.

        2. Add the doubled digits and the undoubled digits: 
        4 + 18 + 9 + 4 + 7 + 6 + 9 + 16 + 7 + 16 = 107.

        3. Check divisibility by 10: 107 divisble by 10.

    this would be an invalid card number.
